# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome

My name is **Anthony (TJ) Edens**, and Iâ€™m a DevOps Manager with over 8 years of experience designing automation-first infrastructure, along with 15+ years in full-stack development and Linux systems administration.

I currently lead the DevOps initatives at a Healthcare SaaS, where I:

- Architect and manage multi-account Kubernetes infrastructure with >99.995% uptime
- Run secure, audit-ready CI/CD pipelines for web and mobile apps
- Drive cost optimization initiatives (cutting cloud spend by over 60%)
- Mentor engineers on observability, reliability, and DevSecOps
- Oversee internal IT operations and support HIPAA/SOC2 compliance

Previously, I worked at AC Moore and Capstan supporting AI/ML infrastructure during M&A transitions. Earlier in my career, I built and supported high-availability systems for major hosting providers like SingleHop and InMotion Hosting.
