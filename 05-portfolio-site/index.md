# Welcome!

I'm **Anthony Edens**, a DevOps Manager with over 7 years of experience in automation, infrastructure, and engineering leadership—and more than a decade of backend development and systems administration before that.

Currently, I manage **six AWS environments** at Claimocity, where I:
- Architect and maintain Kubernetes clusters with >99.995% uptime
- Run secure CI/CD pipelines that support mobile and web applications
- Lead cost optimization efforts (saving 60%+ cloud spend)
- Mentor development teams on security, observability, and scalability
- Oversee internal IT operations and manage compliance audits

Previously, I served as a DevOps Engineer at AC Moore/Capstan, supporting AI-driven applications and orchestrating infrastructure transitions through company acquisition. My roots are in Linux systems administration and PHP/Python backend development at InMotion Hosting and SingleHop—two major web hosting providers.

This portfolio showcases just a few of the foundational systems and workflows I’ve designed or built:

## 🔧 Projects
- [CI/CD Pipeline](projects/01-ci-cd-pipeline.html) — GitHub Actions + Docker
- [Kubernetes Local Environment](projects/02-k8s-local-env.html) — Local app deployment using Docker Desktop + K8s
- [Infrastructure as Code](projects/03-iac-terraform.html) — AWS provisioning with modular Terraform
- [Monitoring & Logging](projects/04-monitoring-logging.html) — Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki stack via Docker Compose
- [Portfolio Site](projects/05-portfolio-site.html) — This site, built with Jekyll and GitHub Pages

## 🔍 Focus Areas
- Scalable cloud architecture (AWS, GCP, Azure)
- CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration, infrastructure as code
- Monitoring, observability, and cost-efficiency
- Security best practices and cross-functional DevOps collaboration

## 📫 Availability
I’m open to long-term part-time DevOps contracts (10–25 hrs/week) and fractional CTO advisory roles. I specialize in early-stage technical foundations, migrations, and system hardening.

Thanks for checking out my work!
